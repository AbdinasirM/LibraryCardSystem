Project Idea: Library Management System

Description:
Create a library management system that helps librarians keep track of books, patrons, and borrowing records. The system should allow librarians to add new books to the library, register new patrons, and manage the borrowing and returning of books.

Key Features:

    Book Management:
        Add new books to the library with details like title, author, ISBN, genre, etc.
        Maintain a database of available books and their status (available, borrowed, or reserved).
        Allow librarians to update book details or remove books from the library.

    Patron Management:
        Register new patrons by collecting information such as name, contact details, and membership ID.
        Maintain a database of registered patrons and their borrowing history.

    Borrowing and Returning:
        Enable patrons to borrow books by checking their availability and updating the status accordingly.
        Set a due date for borrowed books and send reminders to patrons when the due date approaches.
        Handle book returns, updating the availability status and maintaining borrowing records.

    Search and Filtering:
        Implement search functionality to find books based on criteria like title, author, genre, etc.
        Allow patrons to search for books and check their availability status.

    Reports and Statistics:
        Generate reports on the borrowing history of patrons, popular books, overdue books, etc.
        Display statistics such as the total number of books in the library, total borrowed books, etc.

    User Interface:
        Design a user-friendly console-based or GUI-based interface for librarians and patrons to interact with the system.
        Implement menus, input forms, and intuitive navigation to enhance usability.

This project will provide you with a good understanding of core C++ concepts such as classes, objects, data structures, file handling, and user input/output. It will also help you improve your problem-solving and software development skills.

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks, plan the structure of your code, and consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to efficiently manage the library's data.
